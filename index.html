<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>In light of the pandemic, we have seen how crucial it is to support local business in our community. Small businesses have faced many shutdowns and restrictions due to Covid-19, and are continuing to suffer as they struggle to keep up with price increases without losing customers to larger competitors. To combat this issue, we came up with a solution: BuyLocal. BuyLocal is a website that allows users to discover local and small businesses in their area and support them through purchasing their products. Our website uses both your location and individual preferences to streamline the process of finding local and small businesses near you to shop from, instead of buying from chain stores. Through supporting the local community, users are not only driving the American economy, but also putting money back into the local economy, enabling the creation of new small businesses and improving the communities public services.

So why use this website? We encourage you to use our website simply because it is better in all ways; it is better for you, better for the community, and better for your family.</p>
